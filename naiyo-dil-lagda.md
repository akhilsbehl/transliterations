# Naiyo dil lagda, Javed Bashir

## Original

tere gam lag jaawan mainu  
tera vaal viga na hove  
lokaan chaari hasne aan  
dil chori chori rove  
aashiq da dil sheeshe varga  
lage thes te tut khalove

================================================================================

manzoor miya  
oda jina ki ae  
jida darde koi na hove  
sun mere haniya  
dil deya jaaniya  
teriyaan udeekaan vich  
muk chale saan  

ve ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda mera  
ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda ve mera

================================================================================

wasda jahaan mera  
tere dam naal ve  
lagiyaan da dhola koi  
kar le khyaal ve  
rovaan gal laa ke main  
teriyaan nishaniyaan  
hanjuan de dive balaan  
vekhan tera raah  

ve ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda mera  
ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda ve mera

================================================================================

vasdeyaan naal te har koi lad-da  
teri ujadayaan naal ladaai  
ghar kuj hosh akal vich aaja  
tainu aje vi samajh na aayi  
dil cheer vikhavaan kenu  
tenu kive main devaan safaai  
gaur miyaan, je vichde mar gaye  
gal karse kul khudaai  

ve ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda mera  
ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda ve mera

================================================================================

saamne yaar akhaan de tur gaye  
mainu laa gaye rog awalle  
mainu nit udeekaan raiyaan ne  
ona ja paigam na galle  
*moolo de vich paambad balde*
meri jindadi sek na jalle  
main ta mahiyaa tere bajon  
ghar chhod ke jangal malle  

ve ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda mera  
ghar aaja  
naiyo dil lagda ve mera

## Transliteration

May I borrow your sorrows;  
Let no hair on your head wilt.  
I smile in company  
Whilst my heart weeps.  
A lover's heart, 'tis but of glass  
The merest blow may shatter.

================================================================================

Do you agree,  
What life of a wretch  
Who can share no pain?  
Listen, my friend,  
My heart's beloved,  
I await thy return,  
While my breath wanes.  

Oh, come back,  
Nothing consoles my heart.  
Come back, please,  
To my heart.

================================================================================

My world thrives,  
At your behest.  
To this faith, my love,  
You must be just.  
I gather to my bosom, and weep  
To your souvenirs,  
With those tears, I light lamps,  
And seek your return.

Oh, come back,  
Nothing consoles my heart.  
Come back, please,  
To my heart.

================================================================================

All and sundry fight the flourishing  
You insist on fighting the barren.  
Have sense and come back home  
Do you not still comprehend?  
To whom do I rend my heart  
Oh, how must I plead?  
Consider love, if we die bereft,  
Would not the world and the heavens mock?  

Oh, come back,  
Nothing consoles my heart.  
Come back, please,  
To my heart.

================================================================================

I beheld my love forsake me  
Seed me with an indelible disease.  
I have since searched and sought.  
My missives melt him no more.  
*My core is consumed by a fire*  
My life, yet, extinguished.  
Since you left, my dear,  
I fled the hearth into the wild.  

Oh, come back,  
Nothing consoles my heart.  
Come back, please,  
To my heart.
